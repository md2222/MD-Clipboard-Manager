MD Clipboard Manager


About

Simple Clipboard Manager. 

Shortcut needs to be registered through the settings offered by whatever desktop environment you use.\
For Linux Mint use System Settings (Preferences) > Keyboard > Shortcuts. For Command use "your-bin-dir/mdclip -m".
Shift+Insert is good for me.
